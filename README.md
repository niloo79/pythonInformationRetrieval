# Python Information Retrieval

This project contains two python based post retrieval query performance predictors

-  WIG - weighted information gain:
   -  Measures the separation between the mean retrieval score of the top-ranked documents and that of the entire corpus. A retrieval is deemed effective when there is a higher similarity between the top-ranked documents and the query, with respect to the similarity between the query and a non-relevant document, the corpus.
    
- Clarity:
  - The Clarity predictor measures the coherence between the list of retrieved documents in relation to the corpus. Coherence refers to the extent to which the top-ranked documents share the same vocabulary. 


### For more information on WIG and Clarity, please review the WIG and Clarity readme files.
